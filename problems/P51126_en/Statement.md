# Intervals (1)

Write a program that, given two intervals, computes the interval
corresponding to their intersection, or tells that it is empty.

## Input

Input consists of four integer numbers $a_1$, $b_1$, $a_2$, $b_2$ that
represent the intervals $[a_1,b_1]$ and $[a_2,b_2]$. Assume $a_1\le b_1$
and $a_2\le b_2$.

## Output

Print "`[]`" if their intersection is empty, or "`[`$x$`,`$y$`]`" if
this is their non-empty intersection.
