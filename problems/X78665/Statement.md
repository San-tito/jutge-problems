# Recursive pattern with squares

Deduce from the examples what has to be done in this exercise. Find a
solution using a function/action which is **RECURSIVE** and writes to
the output. It is allowed that the function/action uses loops, but the
solution to the general problem must be **RECURSIVE**.

## Input

The input in this exercise consists of several cases. Each case consists
of a positive natural in one line.

## Output

For each case, a recursive sequence is written at the output, followed
by a blank line. Pay attention to the examples to deduce what the output
is as a function of the input.
