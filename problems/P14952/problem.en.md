# Topological sort

We must perform $n$ tasks, one at a time. Furthermore, some tasks must
be done before others: there are $m$ precedence relations between tasks.
Write a program to print a way to sort the $n$ tasks satisfying the $m$
given precedences.

## Input

Input consists of several cases. Every case begins with $n$, followed by
$m$, followed by $m$ distinct pairs $x$ $y$ that indicate that task $x$
must be done before task $y$. You can assume $1 \le n \le 10^4$,
$0 \le m \le 10n$, and that the tasks are numbered from 0 to $n - 1$.

## Output

For every case, print the lexicographically smallest order of the $n$
tasks that fulfills the $m$ given precedences. There will always be, at
least, one solution.
