# Allowance (3)

You have saved $n$ euros. Additionally, every Monday of the forthcoming
weeks you will be given a weekly allowance. On odd weeks, you get $a_o$
euros, while on even weeks you will receive $a_e$ euros. On the $i$-th
week, your amount of expenses sums up to $d_i$ euros. The first week is
the week $i=1$ and, therefore, it is an odd week.

Write a program that computes the balance at the end of each week.

## Input

The input consists of three natural numbers, $a_o \geq  0$, $a_e 
\geq  0$ and $n \geq  0$. Representing the allowance on odd weeks, the
allowance on even weeks and the initial savings, respectively.

Following, there is a non-empty sequence of natural numbers where each
element $d_i\geq 0$. Each element $d_i$ represents the expenses of the
$i$-th week.

## Output

The output is a sequence of integers. Each element of this sequence
$b_i$ indicates the balance at the end of the $i$-th week, once the
corresponding expenses are payed.

Follow the format specified in the examples. Your code should follow the
rules of style and contain the comments that you deem appropriate.  \
