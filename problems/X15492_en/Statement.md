# Add one to even digits

Write a program that reads numbers from the input and prints them after
having added 1 to their even digits.

For instance, the program will transform number `785902` into `795913`.

## Input

The input has many cases. Each case is a natural number in one line.

## Output

For each case, the output is a separate line with the number with its
even digits incremented by 1.

## Observation

Massive storage solutions are not accepted (like `string`s or
`vector`s). Read numbers from the input into variables of type `int`,
for example with `cin `$>>$` a`, and solve the problem operating with
integers using `+`, `-`, , `/`, and `%`.

Evaluation over 10 points:

- Slow solution: 5 points.

- Fast solution: 10 points.

We understand as fast solution one which is correct, has linear cost and
passes the public and private tests. We understand as slow solution one
which is not fast, but it is correct and passes the public tests.
