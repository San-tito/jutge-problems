# Read a rational number (1)

Write a procedure

        void read_rational(int& num, int& den);

to read a rational number given in the form "numerator"`/`"denominator",
and store these two values in \@num@ and \@den@, respectively.
Additionally, you must remove all common factors from \@num@ and \@den@.
For instance, if the input has

    66/12

the values after the call must be \@num@ $= 11$ and \@den@ $= 2$.

## Precondition

$1 \le$ \@num@ $\le 10^9$ and $1 \le$ \@den@ $\le 10^9$

## Observation

You only need to submit the required procedure; your main program will
be ignored.
