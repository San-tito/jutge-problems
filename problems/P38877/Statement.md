# Reversing a list of words (4)

Write a program that reads a number $n$ and a sequence of $n$ or more
words, and prints the $n$ last words in reverse order.

## Input

Input begins with a natural number $n$, followed by, at least, $n$
words.

## Output

Print the last $n$ words of the original sequence, in reverse order, and
one per line.

## Observation

For the sake of practice, use recursion (not arrays).
