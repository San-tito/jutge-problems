# Reversing a list of words (6)

Write a program that reads a sequence of words and prints, in reverse
order, the first half of the list.

## Input

Input consists of a sequence of words.

## Output

If $n$ denotes the total number of words, print the
$\lfloor n/2 \rfloor$ first words of the original sequence, in reverse
order, and one per line.

## Observation

For the sake of practice, use recursion (not arrays).
