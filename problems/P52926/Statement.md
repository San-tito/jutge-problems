# Reversing a list of words (2)

Write a program that reads a sequence of words until the first
appearance of the word "`end`", and prints it reversed.

## Input

Input consists of a sequence of words. At least one is "`end`".

## Output

Print all the words of the original sequence until the first appearance
of "`end`", in reverse order, and one per line.

## Observation

For the sake of practice, use recursion (not arrays).
