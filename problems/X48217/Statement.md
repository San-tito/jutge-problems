# Enumerate sandwich numbers

Exactly like in the exercise \"Sandwich numbers\", we define a sandwich
number as a natural number $n$ with only two different digits $d$ and
$e$ that are repeated in the form $de_1e_2\cdots e_kd$, with $k \geq 1$.

Write a **program** that displays all the sandwich numbers of $X$ digits
on the screen.

## Input

The input consists of a natural number $X$, with $3 \leq X \leq 9$.

## Output

A list of sandwich numbers of $X$ digits, one per line. The numbers can
be written **in any order**. You can generate the numbers as you wish,
either as integers or character by character.
