# Most frequent factor

Write a procedure

        void factor(int n, int& f, int& q);

to store in \@f@ the most frequent factor of \@n@, and store in \@q@ how
many times it appears. If there is a tie, choose the smallest factor.
For instance, if called with \@n@ $= 450 = 2^1 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5^2$, the
values after the call must be \@f@ $=3$ and \@q@ $= 2$.

## Precondition

\@n@ $\ge 2$

## Observation

You only need to submit the required procedure; your main program will
be ignored.
