# Most frequent words

Write a program that reads a sequence of $n$ words and prints the $k$
most frequent (in case of a tie, the smallest in alphabetical order).

## Input

Input consists of several cases. Every case starts with $n$ and $k$,
followed by $n$ words made up of only lowercase letters. You can assume
that $k$ is between 1 and the number of different words.

## Output

For every case, print the $k$ most frequent words in order. Print first
the most frequent words, and in case of a tie, the smallest words in
lexicographical order. Print a line with 10 dashes at the end of each
case.
