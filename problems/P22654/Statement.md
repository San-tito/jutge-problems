# Time decomposition (2)

Write a procedure

        void decompose(int n, int& h, int& m, int& s);

that, given a quantity of seconds \@n@, computes how many hours \@h@,
minutes \@m@ and seconds \@s@ it represents. That is, we must have \@s@
$+ \ 60$\@m@ $+ \ 3600$\@h@ $=$ \@n@, with $0\le$ \@s@ $<60$ and $0\le$
\@m@ $<60$.

## Precondition

$n$ is a natural number.

## Observation

You only need to submit the required procedure; your main program will
be ignored.
