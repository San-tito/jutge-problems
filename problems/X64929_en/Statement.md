# Happiness and Sadness (1)

We define the happiness level of a text as the number of occurrences of
subwords `":-)"` and `"(-:"`.

We define the sadness level of a text as the number of occurrences of
subwords `":-("` and `")-:"`.

Implement a program such that, given a sequence of characters from
`{’-’, ’:’, ’(’, ’)’}`, prints its level of happiness and sadness.

## Input

The input contains only one line with a sequence of characters from
`{’-’, ’:’, ’(’, ’)’}`.

## Output

The output has two numbers separated by a white space, the happiness and
sadness levels of the input text.

## Observation

Do not use `strings` nor any other massive data storage method. Read and
treat the input character by character.
