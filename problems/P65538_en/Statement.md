# Mode

Write a program that finds the most frequent word for every given
sequence of words.

## Input

Input consists of several cases. Every case begins with a number $n$
between 1 and $10^5$, followed by $n$ words made up of only lowercase
letters. A special case with $n = 0$ marks the end of input.

## Output

For every case, print the word that appears more times. If there is a
tie, print the largest word in alphabetical order.
