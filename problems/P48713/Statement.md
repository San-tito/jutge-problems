# Primality

Write a program that reads a sequence of natural numbers and, for each
one, tells if it is a prime number or not. Remember that a natural
number is prime if and only if it is greater than 1 and it does not have
any positive divisor other than 1 and itself.

## Input

Input consists of a number $n$, followed by $n$ natural numbers.

## Output

For every given natural number, tell in a line if it is prime or not,
following the format of the example.

## Hint

For every given $n$, at most about $\sqrt{n}\,$ steps are needed to know
if it is prime or not.
