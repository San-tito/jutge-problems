# Computing areas

Write a program that reads several descriptions of rectangles and
circles, and for each one prints its corresponding area.

## Input

Input begins with a number $n$, followed by $n$ descriptions. If of a
rectangle, we have the word "`rectangle`" followed by two strictly
positive real numbers: its length and its width. If of a circle, we have
the word "`circle`" followed by a strictly positive real number: its
radius.

## Output

For each description, print its area with 6 digits after the decimal
point.
