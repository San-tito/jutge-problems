# Polynomial evaluation (1)

Write a program that reads a number $x$ and a polynomial
$p(z) = c_0 z^0 + c_1 z^1 + \cdots + c_n z^n$, and computes $p(x)$.

## Input

Input consists of a real number $x$ followed by the description of the
polynomial $p(z)$: the real coefficients $c_0$, $c_1$, ..., $c_n$ in
this order. (The first sample input/output corresponds to the evaluation
of $p(z) = 3 + 4z + 5z^2$ at $x = 2$.)

## Output

Print $p(x)$ with 4 digits after the decimal point.
