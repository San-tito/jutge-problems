# Trigonometry

Write a program that reads a sequence of angles in degrees, and prints
their sine and their cosine.

## Input

Input consists of a sequence of real numbers that represent angles in
degrees.

## Output

For each given angle, print a line with its sine and its cosine. Print
all the numbers with six digits after the decimal point.

## Observation

Use the procedures that your programming language already provides to
compute sines and cosines.
