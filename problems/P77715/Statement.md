# Pangrams

A *pangram* is a sentence that contains all the alphabet letters. For
instance, `The quick brown dog jumps over the lazy fox` and the catalan
sentence `Jove xef, porti whisky amb quinze glacons d’hidrogen` are
pangrams.

Write a program that prints if determined sentences are pangrams or are
not.

## Input

Input is a sequence of sentence, each one ended with a dot. Each
sentence is formed by letters (uppercase or lowercase), spaces and
commas.

## Output

For each sentence of the input, print "`YES`" or "`NO`" in a line
indicating if is a pangram. We consider that letters are characters
betwwen '`a`' and '`z`' and between '`A`' and '`Z`', no mattering if
they are uppercase or lowercase letters.
