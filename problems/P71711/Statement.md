# Zig-zag

Write a program that reads several matrices of integer numbers, and that
for each one tells whether the result of traversing it in zig-zags is a
strictly increasing sequence. We must start at the top-left position, go
down the first column, up the second column, down the third column, and
so on.

## Input

Input consists of several matrices, each with the number of rows
$r \ge 1$ and the number of columns $c \ge 1$, followed by $r$ rows with
$c$ integer numbers each.

## Output

For every matrix, print its number followed by either "`yes`" o "`no`",
depending on whether the zig-zag traversal of the matrix generates a
strictly increasing sequence or not.
