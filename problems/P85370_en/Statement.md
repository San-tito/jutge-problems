# Interest (1)

Given an initial capital $c$ in euros, an annual interest rate $i$
(expressed in %), a time $t$ in years and an indication whether the
interest is simple or compound, determine the amount of euros the
initial capital is transformed into.

## Input

The input consists of two strictly positive real numbers $c$ and $i$,
followed by a strictly positive integer $t$, followed by either the word
"`simple`" or the word "`compound`".

## Output

Write the final capital with 4 decimal places.

## Observation

If you program in C++, use the `double` data type and put these two
lines at the beginning of your `main()`:

        cout.setf(ios::fixed);
        cout.precision(4);
