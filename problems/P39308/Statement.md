# Divisors in order

Write a program to print in order all the divisors of a given number.

## Input

Input consists of several cases, each with a natural number $n$ between
1 and $10^9$.

## Output

For every $n$, print the divisors of $n$ in increasing order.

## Observations

- Your program must be "efficient" to be accepted by the judge.

- You are not allowed to use vectors or alike.

## Hint

Every divisor smaller than the square root of $n$ has a corresponding
divisor greater than the square root of $n$. It could be useful to make
two loops, one for "small" divisors, and another for "large" divisors.
