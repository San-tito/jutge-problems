# Comparing results of operations

Implement a program that reads boolean expressions of comparison between
an arithmetic operation between naturals and a natural number, and
determines if they evaluate to `true` or `false`.

## Input

Each line of the input has the following format:

    NUM1 OPERATOR NUM2 COMPARATOR NUM3

Where `NUM1, NUM2, NUM3` are naturals, `OPERATOR` is an operator from
`{+,-,*}`, and COMPARATOR is a comparison operator from
`{,<=,>=,==,!=}`.

## Output

For each input line, the output has `true` or `false`, the boolean value
resulting from evaluating the boolean expression represented by the
line.
