# Given four integers, check that two of them are equal and the other two are different

Write a program that reads four integers and determines if two of them
are equal and the remaining ones are different from any other.

## Input

Four integers in one line.

## Output

If two integers in the input are equal to each other and the other two
are different from any other one then print `YES`. Otherwise, print
`NO`.

## Observation

You cannot use massive storage data structures, such as `string` or
`vector`.
