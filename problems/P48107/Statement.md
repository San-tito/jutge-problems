# Integer division and remainder of two natural numbers

Write a program that reads two natural numbers $a$ and $b$, with
$b > 0$, and prints the integer division $d$ and the remainder $r$ of
$a$ divided by $b$.

Remember that, by definition, $d$ i $r$ must be the only integer numbers
such that $0 \le r < b$ and $d \cdot b + r = a$.

## Input

Input consists of $a$ and $b$, with $b > 0$.

## Output

Print a line with the integer division and the remainder of $a$ divided
by $b$, separated by a space.

## Observation

Although the conditions for the input of this exercise prevent divisions
by zero, check what happens to your program in that case.
