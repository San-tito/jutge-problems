# Increasing diagonals

Given a rectangular matrix $n \times m$, and an initial position in the
matrix, determine whether the four diagonals starting at the initial
position have elements in strictly increasing order or not.

## Input

The input is formed by several cases. Each case starts with the number
of rows $n$ and the number of columns $m$, followed by $n$ lines with
$m$ integers each. The case ends with the row and colummn of the initial
position (starting at 0).

## Output

For each case, write "`yes`" or "`no`" accordingly.

Your program should follow a right programming style. Please, include
the appropriate comments.
