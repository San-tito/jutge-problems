# Fields

A rectangular field of size $m\times n$ contains $mn$ square areas. Some
of the areas are occupied by a determinated growing (tomatoes, carrots,
etc.) that is identified by a natural number strictly positive. It is
known that growings are grouped in different disjointed rectangles and
that a growing always is separated of another one by areas without
grownings, identify by the value 0.

Write a program that reads fields and prints the number of rectangular
growings.

## Input

Input consists in a sequence of fields. For each field, it is given two
natural numbers $m$ and $n$ with $m\ge1$ and $n\ge1$ that represent the
size of the field. Then, it is given $m$ rows, each one with $n$ natural
numbers that represent the growing of the area. The fields follow the
hypotheses described previously.

## Output

For each fielf of the input, print in a line the number of rectangular
growings.
