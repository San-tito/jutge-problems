# Drawing parallelepipeds

Write a program that reads several triplets of natural numbers $b$, $h$
and $d$, and for each one prints a parallelepiped of base $b$, height
$h$ and depth $d$.

## Input

Input consists of several triplets of strictly positive natural numbers
$b$, $h$ and $d$, with $h\ge d$.

## Output

For every triplet, print a parallelepiped of base $b$, height $h$ and
depth $d$, as it is shown in the example. Print an empty line after each
parallelepiped.
