# Control C501A

Your task is to write a program that, for each $n$ given, prints the $n$
smallest first prime numbers.

## Input

The input is a sequence of natural numbers $n$ with $1 \le n \le 1000$.

## Output

For each $n$, print a line with the $n$ first prime numbers, in
increasing order, and separated by a comma.

## Observation

Before reading any $n$, do a sieve of Eratosthenes to precalculate the
first 1000 prime numbers. Knowing that 7919 is the prime number 1000
could be useful.
