# Rows and columns

Write a program that reads a matrix, and afterwards prints the rows, the
columns and the elements that are asked for.

## Input

Input consists of a matrix followed by a sequence of questions about the
matrix. The matrix is described with two natural numbers $n > 0$ and
$m > 0$, followed by $n$ lines with $m$ integer numbers each one. Every
question begins with the word "`row`", "`column`" or "`element`". If the
word is "`row`", it is followed by the number of a row. If the word is
"`column`", it is followed by the number of a column. If the word is
"`element`", it is followed by the number of a row and the number of a
column. All the given numbers of row and of column are correct, and
start with 1.

## Output

For every question, print the row, the column, or the element asked for.
