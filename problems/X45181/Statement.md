# Generating braids

Write a program that, given triplets of positive natural numbers
`lines, width, segment`, generates braids as shown in the examples.

## Input

An arbitrary number of cases, each consisting of three positive natural
numbers in one line.

## Output

For each case, the corresponding braid, followed by a blank line.

## Observation

You can write the output character by character or by previously
building strings, as you wish.

Grading up to 10 points:

- Slow solution: 5 points.

- Fast solution: 10 points.

We understand as a fast solution one which is correct, with linear cost
and which passes the public and private tests. We understand as slow
solution one which is not fast, but it is correct and passes the public
tests.
