Write a program that computes the greatest common divisor of two
numbers.

## Input

Input consists of two strictly positive natural numbers $a$ and $b$.

## Output

Print the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$.

## Observation

Although the solution to this exercise does not need to be very
efficient, it should not be too slow.
