# Two coins of each kind (3)

Given a number $x$ and $n$ different coin values $c_1 \ldots c_n$,
compute in how many ways it is possible to achieve change $x$ by using
each value at most twice. Here, two coins with the same value are
considered equal.

For example, if $x = 4$ and the available values are 1 and 2, then there
are two ways to achieve it: $1 + 1 + 2$ and $2 + 2$. As another example,
if $x = 5$ and the available values are 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, then there are
five ways: $1 + 1 + 3$, $1 + 2 + 2$, $1 + 4$, $2 + 3$ and 5.

## Input

Input consists of several cases, with only integer numbers. Every case
begins with $x$ and $n$, followed by $c_1 \ldots c_n$. Assume
$1 \le n \le 15$, $1 \le c_i \le x \le 10^6$, and that all $c_i$ are
different.

## Output

For every case print the number of different ways to achieve change
exactly $x$ by using each value at most twice.

## Hint

A simply pruned backtracking should be enough.
