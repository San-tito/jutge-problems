# Enumerate bicolor numbers

Exactly as in the exercise \"Bicolor Numbers\", we define a *bicolor*
number as a natural number $n$ with only two different digits that are
repeated in two blocks (or \"colors\").

Write a **program** that prints all bicolor numbers with $N$ digits.

## Input

The input consists of a natural number $N$, with $N \geq 2$.

## Output

A list of bicolor numbers with $N$ digits, one per line. The numbers can
be written **in any order**. You can generate the output as you wish,
either using integers or generating the numbers character by character.
