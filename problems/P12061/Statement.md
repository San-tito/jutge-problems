# Words between two words

Write a program that, given a sequence of words, prints the number of
words between the word "`beginning`" and the word "`end`". If the word
"`beginning`", the word "`end`" or both words are missing, or if they
appear in inverse order, tell so.

## Input

Input consists of several words. The words "`beginning`" and "`end`"
appear, at most, once.

## Output

Print the number of words between the word "`beginning`" and the word
"`end`", if these appear in this order. Otherwise, print
"`wrong sequence`".
