# Distance between two points

Using the definition

        struct Point {
            double x, y;
        };

write a function

        double dist(const Point& a, const Point& b);

that returns the euclidean distance between two points \@a@ and \@b@.

## Observation

You only need to submit the required classes; your main program will be
ignored.

Strictly obey the type definitions of the statement.
