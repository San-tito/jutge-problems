# Recursive words

Deduce what has to be done in this problem by looking at the
input-output examples.

## Input

The input has several cases. Each one consists of a single digit $d$ in
one line.

## Output

For each case from the input, the output has a `string` in a new line.
Deduce the expected string for each $d$ from the examples.

## Observation

**The solution for this exercise must be recursive.** You can either
make a recursive function which directly prints the string on the
output, or a function that returns the string and it is the main program
who prints it. You can use a loop in the body of the function, if you
wish, but the general solution must be recursive.
