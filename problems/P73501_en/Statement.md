# Increasing pairs

Write a program that reads sequences of natural numbers, and that for
each one prints the number of pairs of consecutive numbers such that the
second number of the pair is greater than the first one.

## Input

Input consists of a natural number $n$, followed by $n$ sequences of
strictly positive natural numbers. Each sequence ends with a zero.

## Output

For every sequence, print in a line the number of pairs of consecutive
numbers such that the second number of the pair is greater than the
first one.
