# Similar sequences (2)

In this problem, we say that two sequences of numbers are similar if
both have the same sum and finalize with the same number. Provide a
program that computes how many of the given sequences are similar to the
first (this one included).

In your program, you have to implement and use the following procedure:

> **void** *info_sequence*(**int**& sum, **int**& last);

which reads a sequence from the input and computes the parameters *sum*
and *last*, the sum of the elements and the last element of the read
sequence, respectively.

## Input

The input is formed by one or more non-empty sequences of natural
numbers all of them strictly positive. Each sequence is finalized by a
0. The end of the input is marked with an empty sequence.

## Output

Print how many sequences are similar to the first one, including the
first.

## Observation

You cannot use strings, vectors or other data structures.
