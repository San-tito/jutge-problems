# Second maximum word

Write a program that prints the second largest word, in alphabetical
order, of a given a sequence of words, ignoring repetitions.

For instance, if the words are "`hola`", "`adeu`", "`hola`", "`hi`" and
"`bye`", then the asked word is "`hi`", because it is not relevant that
"`hola`" appears more than once.

## Input

Input consists of several words, all made up of only lowercase letters.
There will always be at least two different words.

## Output

Print the second largest word in alphabetical order, ignoring
repetitions.
