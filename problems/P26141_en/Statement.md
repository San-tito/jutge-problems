# Rational numbers (4)

Using the procedures done in the exercises

`RACI1` , `RACI2` and `RACI3` , your task is to write a program that
reads a sequence of rational numbers and operations $$r_0
\quad
o_1 \enspace r_1
\quad
o_2 \enspace r_2
\quad
\dots
\quad
o_{n - 1} \enspace r_{n - 1}
\quad
o_{n} \enspace r_{n}
\quad ,$$ and prints the result after each operation.

## Input

Input consists of a line with an initial rational, followed by a
sequence of lines, each one with a pair operation/rational. As in the
exercise `RACI2` , each rational is given by a pair of integer numbers,
the second integer is not zero. The operations can be "`add`",
"`substract`", "`multiply`" or "`divide`". In this last case, the second
rational is not zero.

## Output

Your program must print the initial rational, followed by the
accumulated result of each operation. Each rational number must be in a
different line.
