# Stamps

We want to send a postcard by mail. We need to stamp worth $n$ cents.
Stamps have values 7 and 4 cents. As space is limited we want to know
the minimum number of stamps we need to put on the postcard, without
losing a cent.

## Input

The input is a sequence of integer numbers. Each number in the sequence
is greater than $19$.

## Output

For each integer $n$ in the input, a line with two numbers $p \ge 0$ and
$q \ge 0$ such that $n = 7p + 4q$ and $p+q$ is minimum among all
possible choices.
