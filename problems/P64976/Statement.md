# Control C201B

The $n$ first lines of multiplication table of a natural number $n$ are
given by $n$ multiplicated by one, two, three, ..., until $n$. For
instance, being $n = 5$ we have $5\times 1=5$, $5\times 2=10$,
$5\times 3=15$, $5\times 4=20$, $5\times 5=25$.

Your task is to write a program that reads a natural number $n$ and
prints the $n$ first lines of its multiplication table.

## Input

The input is a natural number $n$.

## Output

Your program must print the $n$ first lines of the multiplication table
of $n$, following the format of the instances.
