# The sequence of Collatz

Let $n$ be any strictly positive natural number. Consider the following
process. If $n$ is an even number, we divide it by two. Otherwise, we
multiply it by 3 and add 1 to it. When we reach 1, we stop. For
instance, starting with 3, we obtain the sequence
$$3,~ 10,~ 5,~ 16,~ 8,~ 4,~ 2,~ 1 .$$

Since 1937 it is conjectured that this process ends for any initial $n$,
although nobody has been able to prove it. In this problem, we do not
ask you for a proof. You only have to write a program that prints the
number of steps that it takes to reach 1 for every given $n$.

## Input

Input consists of several natural numbers $n \ge 1$.

## Output

For every $n$, print how many steps are needed to reach 1. Suppose that
this number is well defined, that is, that the conjecture of the
statement is true.
