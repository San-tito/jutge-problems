# Anagrams

Two sentences (or two words) are *anagrams* if one can be obtained from
the other one simply reordering their letters (forgetting the spaces and
the punctuation symbols) .

For instance, "`ROME`" and "`MORE`" are anagrams. Also,
"`AVE MARIA, GRATIA PLENA, DOMINUS TECUM`" and
"`VIRGO SERENA, PIA, MUNDA ET IMMACULATA`" are anagrams.

Write a program that prints if the pairs are or are not anagrams.

## Input

Input starts with a number $n$ After, each sentence is given in a line
ending in a dot. The sentences may contain uppercase letters, spaces and
punctuation symbols (but only a dot in the end).

## Output

For each pair of sentences, print "`YES`" if they form an anagram and
"`NO`" otherwise.
