# Stadistical measures

Write a program that reads non-empty sequences of real numbers and, for
each sequence, prints its minimum, its maximum and its average.

## Input

Input consists of a natural number $n$, followed by $n$ sequences. Each
sequence begins with the number of elements $m > 0$, followed by $m$
real numbers.

## Output

For every sequence, print in a line and with four digits after the
decimal point its minimum, its maximum and its average.
