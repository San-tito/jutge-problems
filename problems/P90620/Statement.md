# Pica d'Estats

Write a program that, given a sequence of integer numbers strictly
positive ended with 0, prints if contains any peak greater than 3143
(the height of Pica d'Estats). A peak is an integer of the sequence that
has a predecessor and a successor and it is strictly greater than them.

## Input

Input is a sequence of integer numbers strictly positive ended with 0.
At least, always there are three integer numbers (not counting the 0).

## Output

The output must be "`YES`" if there is any peak greater than 3143, and
"`NO`" otherwise.
