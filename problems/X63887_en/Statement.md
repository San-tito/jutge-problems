# Count submatrices 3x3 with all digits 1, 2, \...,9

Given a matrix with digits 1, 2, ..., 9, you must count how many
submatrices of size $3\times 3$ of the given matrix contain all
different digits 1, 2, ..., 9.

## Input

The input has several cases. Each one starts with two positive natural
numbers $n, m$ in the first line. Afterwards comes a matrix of size
$n\times m$ with digits 1, 2, ..., 9 ($n$ lines with $m$ digits each).

## Output

For each case, the program must write in a new line the number of
submatrices $3\times 3$ inside of which all digits 1, 2, ..., 9 appear.

## Observation

There is no need to optimize this problem. Any reasonably efficient
implementation will pass.

Evaluation over 10 points:

- Passes public test cases: 5 points.

- Passes public and private test cases: 10 points.
